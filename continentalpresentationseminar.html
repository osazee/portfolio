  <h3>My Background</h3>
  <p>I come from a loving family. Like many Nigerian homes, we had our challenges, but there was always love and discipline.</p>
  <p>I attended Continental School at a very critical time in my life. I was struggling with some bad vices and losing direction. But Continental kept me on the right path. The environment was engaging, the teachers supportive, and the healthy competition among peers made learning fun again. I finished around 2008.</p>

      <h3>Higher Education & Career</h3>
      <p>In 2015, I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Benin. Why do I recognize and feel the impact of Continental more than my university? Because Continental shaped my foundation when I needed it most.</p>
      <p>From 2016–2018, I served on a voluntary church mission—this changed my perspective on life and service. After the mission, I returned and wrote the GRE—and aced it.</p>
      <p>I got into Idaho State University for my Master’s in Mechanical Engineering. Along the way, I worked with:</p>
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style-position: inside;">
        <li>Idaho National Laboratory</li>
        <li>Amazon</li>
        <li>US Army</li>
        <li>And now, I’m a Process Engineer at Intel</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Why This Seminar?</h3>
      <p>During a lunch break with Kelvin Omorodion, a colleague and friend—also an alumni of Continental—we reflected on how far we’ve come. As kids, we used to see the Intel logo on computers, never dreaming we’d one day be part of the team that builds the chips powering them.</p>
      <p>We were proud—but also filled with what-ifs:</p>
      <p>What if we had come to the U.S. earlier?</p>
      <p>What if we had known there were bigger dreams beyond just passing JAMB and getting a bank job?:</p>
      <p>That’s how I came up with today’s theme: <strong>“How Can You Dream of What You Don’t Know?”</strong></p>
      <p>My goal is simple: to expand your knowledge, so you don’t limit your dreams. I want to give you the tools and information to dream globally.</p>

      <h3>Student Engagement</h3>
      <p>Let me invite the Senior Prefect to tell us about their goal after secondary school.</p>

      <h3>How My Goals Evolved</h3>
      <p>Back in high school, my dream was simple: pass JAMB, go to university, and maybe work in a bank or as an engineer.</p>
      <p>But there was the “Favour effect”—a shift in mindset and possibilities through the right environment and exposure.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>How You Can Do It Too</h3>
      <p>You don’t need someone to hold your hand every step of the way. Grow the “I can do it” mindset.</p>
      <p>Here are resources that changed my life:</p>
      
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style-position: inside;">
        <li><strong>The Internet:</strong> Everything you need is out there.</li>
        <li><strong>Nairaland.com:</strong> Great for prep, visa tips, scholarships, and choosing interview centers. (Osas vs Person B story: same visa, different centers, different results!)</li>
        <li><strong>University Websites:</strong> All admission and scholarship details are available there. (Amy’s Story: She discovered the You-Win scholarship by doing her research and it made all the difference)</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>

      <h3>Final Words</h3>
      <p>This journey isn’t easy, but it’s possible. I’m standing here as living proof.</p>
      <p>So I leave you with this:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Don’t let your environment limit your dreams. <br>
        Dream boldly. <br>
        Research relentlessly. <br>
        Prepare passionately.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thank you.</p>
